## Quick overview

This tool has been created for custom analysis and visualization of alcohol harms and policies.

Select **<i class="fa fa-upload"></i> Datasets** to load Prevalence/Consumption, Relative Risk, and Morbidity/Mortality datasets.

Select **<i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> Settings** to customize alcohol consumption parameters used in analysis.

Select **<i class="fa fa-calculator"></i> Generate Estimates** to construct a model of alcohol harms and evaluate that model at baseline (i.e. 100% consumption).

Select **<i class="fa fa-plus"></i> New Scenarios** to evaluate the model at additional consumption scenarios (i.e. consumption levels different from 100%).

Select **<i class="fa fa-bar-chart"></i> High Level Results** to create custom visualizations of alcohol-attributable morbidities and mortalities (only available when corresponding morbidity/mortality data is uploaded).

Select **<i class="fa fa-table"></i> Analyst Level Results** to view and download raw alcohol-attributable fractions, derived consumption data, and derived morbidity/mortality statistical adjustments.

When new datasets are loaded or consumption parameters are modified, estimates must be re-generated for changes to take effect.

## More information

This tool is developed in conjunction with `intermahpr`, the R package that serves as a backend to the tool.

For more information on use of this tool, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/uvic-cisur/intermahp#readme">see the README</a>.

To explore the `intermahpr` backend, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/uvic-cisur/intermahpr">see the GitHub page</a>.

A comprehensive guide to the estimation of alcohol-attributable morbidity and mortality is available on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uvic.ca/research/centres/cisur/projects/intermahp/index.php">InterMAHP homepage</a>.
It contains a thorough discussion of the employed methodology and a complete list of references.
