# The International Model of Alcohol Harms and Policies

> *Copyright 2018 Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research. Licensed under the MIT license.*

This RStudio Shiny app provides an interface to the International Model of Alcohol Harms and Policies (InterMAHP), an R package used to compute Alcohol Attributable Fractions (AAFs), explore change in alcohol consumption scenarios, visualize the results, and download relevant computed statistics in .csv format.  Users provide statistics on drinking prevalence, average alcohol consumption, and total deaths and/or hospitalizations in their region.  A customizable table used to generate condition-specific relative risk curves is also provided. InterMAHP is available online (not yet public), or it can be [run locally](#running-intermahp-locally).

This document serves as a tutorial for the app, and complements the guides found on [InterMAHP's homepage](https://www.uvic.ca/research/centres/cisur/projects/intermahp/index.php) at the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research.
